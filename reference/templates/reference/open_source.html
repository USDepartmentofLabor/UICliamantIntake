  We have opened up the source code for the Claimant Experience pilot application that the U.S.
  Department of Labor created in partnership with the Arkansas Devision of Workforce Services
  and the New Jersey Department of Labor & Workforce Development. The open source code can be
  found on GitHub here [link tbd].
  </p>
  <p>
    The application code includes the following functionality:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identity proofing at Identity Assurance Level (IAL) 2</li>
    <li>Centralized, initial Unemployment Insurance (UI) claim intake</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are a couple ways we recommend interactive with the code. One way is for engineers
    to pull the code down to their local computers, follow the setup instructions (colocated
    with the code), and explore the running application. Another way to engage is to explore
    the code as it uses many best practices from which your engineers can pick and choose to
    implement. These best practices can both improve the experience UI claimants and result
    in the ability to make changes to your code faster.
  </p>
  <p>Some of the best practices included in the open-sourced code include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using an accessible, mobile-first, modern design system</li>
    <li>Automated, real-time quality feedback mechanisms</li>
    <li>Feature flagging to unblock deployments and run experiments</li>
    <li>Using internationalization libraries for translations</li>
    <li>Methods to express and store complex data relationships</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To assist in understanding and implementing these best practices, we have described how we
    implemented them in a UI-specific system below.

  <h2>Using an accessible, mobile-first, modern design system</h2>
  <p>The Claimant Experience pilot application uses the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/">U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</a> for all of its user interfaces. USWDS components are responsive by default, so they work on mobile, tablet, and desktop views out of the box without any additional coding.</p>
  <p>The following image shows a mobile vs. desktop side-by-side comparison of one page in the claimant experience application:</p>
  <p>[Example image showing our app on mobile vs desktop view]</p>
  <p>While using a design system like USWDS doesn't guarantee accessibility, it makes achieving accessibility easier. For example, some of the more complex components have explanations of the accessibility research that has gone into the design decisions surrounding those components. Additionally, many components in the design system are accompanied by guidance on accessible implementation.</p>
  <p>One final benefit of using a design system like USWDS is the maintenance of that system is taken on by another organization, freeing up your engineers and designers to focus on UI system implementation.</p>

<section class="usa-section">
  <h2>Automated, real-time quality feedback mechanisms</h2>
  <p>One challenge in maintaining a complex system like the Claimant Experience pilot is the ability to maintain quality while being able to make changes quickly. One way to meet this challenge is by implementing automated, real-time (or near real-time) quality feedback mechanisms. The Claimant Experience pilot application has implemented the following automated processes to ensure quality. Note that all tools mentioned are open source/free to use.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unit tests of our front-end code with <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>.</li>
    <li>Unit tests of our backend code with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest">Python unittest module</a>.</li>
    <li>End-to-end tests of our entire application using <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress</a>.</li>
    <li>Automated accessibility testing within our end-to-end tests using <a href="https://pa11y.org/">pa11y</a>.</li>
    <li>Performance testing within our end-to-end tests using <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci">Lighthouse CI</a>.</li>
    <li>Requiring at least 90% of our code be covered by tests.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A continuous integration server runs all of our quality checks whenever we want to merge code into our main development branch. If any of these quality checks fails, our code can't be pushed to production. With these checks in place, we can move quickly and with confidence.</p>

  <h2>Feature flagging to unblock deployments and run experiments</h2>
  <p>
    One blocker for rapid code deployments is having an unreleasable main development branch due to in-flight features. This can be mitigated by using feature flagging: a technique used to toggle functionality on or off in an application. The Claimant Experience pilot application uses a feature flag software-as-a-service product to gate content that isn't ready to be exposed to users in production. This allows us to keep shipping code to production even if features are partially completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following code snippet shows an example of a feature flag used in the Claimant Experience pilot application Python code. This flag currently prevents the use of a future 1099G upload feature that hasn't been released yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    <pre><code>def v1_act_on_claimant_1099G(request, claimant_id):
    # Get flag value from our flag service
    ld_flag_set = ld_client.variation(
        "allow-1099g-upload", {"key": "anonymous-user"}, False
    )
    # Return a 404 "Not Found" error if the flag is off
    if not ld_flag_set:
        logger.debug("allow-1099g-upload off")
        return JsonResponse({"status": "error", "error": "route not found"}, status=404)

    # Handle the request if the flag is on
    return v1_POST_1099G(request, claimant_id)</code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>Feature flags also allow you to run experiments: flags can be used to show different versions of content to different users, and then you can measure the performance of different iterations of content.</p>

<section class="usa-section">
  <h2>Using internationalization libraries for translations</h2>
  <p>The Claimant Experience pilot application uses internationalization libraries (e.g., <a href="https://react.i18next.com/">react-i18next</a>) that can be used to display text in mulitple languages. These libraries use user-provided translation strings rather than automatic text translation, providing for clearer communication with non-English speaking claimants.</p>
</section>

<section class="usa-section">
  <h2>Methods to express and store complex data relationships</h2>
  <p>Claims data is complex. There are many potential shapes that claim data might have depending on how a claimant answers questions. Because of this, the Claimant Experience pilot team elected to store claims data as semi-structured JSON files. The JSON data is validated using <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, which offers a way to codify complex data relationships.</p>
  <p>The following example shows how union membership can be expressed with JSON schema. By default, only the <code>is_union_member</code> field needs to be completed. However, if <code>is_union_member</code> is <code>true</code>, then <code>union_name</code>, <code>union_local_number</code>, and <code>required_to_seek_work_through_hiring_hall</code> all become required fields.</p>
  <p>
    <pre>
<code>{
  "union_membership": {
    "$id": "/definitions/union_membership",
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": { "is_union_member": { "type": "boolean" } },
    "required": ["is_union_member"],
    "if": {
      "properties": {
        "is_union_member": { "type": "boolean", "const": true }
      }
    },
    "then": {
      "properties": {
        "union_name": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 32 },
        "union_local_number": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 16 },
        "required_to_seek_work_through_hiring_hall": {
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "union_name",
        "union_local_number",
        "required_to_seek_work_through_hiring_hall"
      ]
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
  </p>
  <p>Using JSON Schema, the Claimant Experience pilot development team was able to express the entire claim form in a single JSON file against which any claim object could be validated.</p>
  <p>An additional benefit of storing claims as semi-structured data was that the application could save in-progress claims: the data did not need to conform to more rigid database specifications but simply had to be saved to an object store. This results in a better experience as claimants do not have to finish the form in one session.</p>
