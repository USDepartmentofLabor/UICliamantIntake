<section class="usa-section">
  <p>Many state workforce agencies are working in challenging environments that include legacy technology. States have limited resources and workloads that can be unpredictable. These factors can make large scale modernization difficult, expensive, and/or time-consuming. However, there are opportunities to make incremental and impactful changes.</p>
  <p>The case study below demonstrates how the state of New Jersey has successfully made significant improvements despite their current technical challenges.</p>

  <h2>Go mobile-friendly with existing technology</h2>

  <p>Mobile-friendly systems and websites are critical given that smart phones are the most accessible (and often only) for many applicants. Few states have mobile-friendly experiences today. According to a Pew Research study titled, “<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/30/racial-and-ethnic-differences-in-how-people-use-mobile-technology/" class="usa-link">Racial and ethnic differences in how people use mobile technology</a>”, 25% of minority populations have smartphones as their only internet device.</p>
  <p>Using cascading style sheets (CSS) media queries, you can make huge improvements to the mobile-friendliness of your site, often without the need to upgrade your software stack or infrastructure. Have a conversation with your engineering experts and share this code to see what’s possible in the short term.</p>
  <p>Below is an example of New Jersey making improvements of the mobile experience without upgrading infrastructure.</p>

  <div class="grid-row grid-gap">
    <div class="grid-col-12 tablet:grid-col-6">
      <h3>Desktop</h3>
      <img class="border-3 border-base-lightest" src="{% static 'reference/nj-desktop.png' %}" alt="New Jersey UI application desktop view" />
    </div>
    <div class="grid-col-12 tablet:grid-col-3">
      <h3>Mobile - before</h3>
      <img class="border-3 border-base-lightest" src="{% static 'reference/nj-mobile-before.png' %}" alt="Previous, unresponsive New Jersey UI application mobile view" />
    </div>
    <div class="grid-col-12 tablet:grid-col-3">
      <h3>Mobile - after</h3>
      <img class="border-3 border-base-lightest" src="{% static 'reference/nj-mobile-after.png' %}" alt="new, responsive New Jersey UI application mobile view" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Media query example</h3>
  <p>
    The following code snippet shows a couple sections of text aligned side-by-side on a page using the CSS flex display property. This works well for wide screens, but appears too narrow on mobile.
  </p>
  <p>
  <pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
  .container {
    display: flex;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
  .container div {
    background-color: #eee;
    padding: 1rem;
    flex-grow: 1;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    To fix this, we can add a media query. The added code in the following snippet translates to "apply these styles if the viewport width is less than or equal to 480 pixels." In this case, we change the container from <code>display: flex</code> to <code>display: block</code> and add some margin around the container's children.
  </p>

  <p><pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
  .container {
    display: flex;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
  .container div {
    background-color: #eee;
    padding: 1rem;
    flex-grow: 1;
  }
  /* Added media query */
  @media (max-width: 480px) {
    .container {
      display: block;
    }
    .container div {
      margin: 1rem;
    }
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
    tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    With this change in hand, we can adjust our screen size and see that, when we cross the 480px breakpoint, our layout changes to be more mobile-friendly. For the example below, the mobile version automatically vertically stacks content to be mobile-friendly.
  </p>
  <div class="grid-row">
    <div class="grid-col-12 tablet:grid-col-7 tablet:padding-right-4">
      <h3>Desktop</h3>
      <div style="gap: 1rem" class="display-flex">
        <div class="padding-2 bg-base-lighter">
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
          tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
        </div>
        <div class="padding-2 bg-base-lighter">
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod

      </div>

  <h2>Experiment from scratch</h2>
  <p>
    When you are not constrained by legacy systems and process, you can make fast progress with new capabilities. You may uncover ideas that you otherwise wouldn't have.
  </p>
  <p>
    USDOL and New Jersey collaborated to build a separate, new site entirely outside of their existing UI website and application. New Jersey is not releasing this application as their new system, but are using pieces of it to improve their existing system. If you build on the side, you may find valuable features to incorporate into your system(s) or you may learn new details that inform your technology roadmap.
  </p>
  <p>
    Explore the sample app source code [insert link here] to see how you can experiment with building outside of your legacy system.

  <h2>Change the frontend without requiring changes on the backend</h2>
  <p>
    A challenge to making changes to application form questions is that it could require changes to the database (or backend). But, it may be possible to update the applicant-facing frontend of the application without changing the backend. This is done by mapping new field options to existing options.
  </p>
  <p>
    By changing the frontend form responses and developing a mapping schema, you can still conform to the database requirements. This enables changes on form questions to be made without a significant tech overhaul.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below is an example of this implemented by New Jersey to add the gender X marker as part of the standard gender question in the unemployment application.
  </p>
  <p class="text-bold">[Example image showing gender X marker implementation]</p>
  <p>
    Use this example to reconsider frontend form question changes that you have considered before, but not been able to implement.

  <a id="make-space"></a>
  <h2>Make space to hear ideas</h2>
  <p>New Jersey, like many states and territories, has struggled to update their UI application because of complicated legacy technology problems. During the pilot, they brought together policy, IT, and innovation teammates to meet and brainstorm. They came up with technical workarounds that enabled them to make short term improvements.</p>
  <p>Below are some of the tactics they used to create space to hear and prioritize ideas. If you haven't already, you can try some of these tactics in your organization to see if they result in any new learnings or opportunities.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      They structured a meeting around an agenda like this:
      <ul>
        <li><span class="text-bold">What are the program office's goals?</span> Define specific claimant-experience goals such as plain language for application questions, accessibility, or mobile-responsiveness.</li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">What are the blockers?</span> Discuss: are there too many other things prioritized, that are preventing action on the aforementioned goals? Is there a technology blocker? Are there other problems that make it difficult to make improvements?</li>
        <li><span class="text-bold">What are some ideas for workarounds?</span> Discuss how to solve the problems or change incrementally to reach claimant experience goals.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>They made sure policy, IT, and innovation decision-makers were present at the meeting, so they could advocate for the importance of the claimant experience goals. Leaders selected ideas to pursue, and the teams scheduled follow-up sessions to dive into implementation details so that tactical logistics did not interfere with the brainstorming meeting.</li>
    <li>They used a round-table style to facilitate the meeting so anyone from the technology side had the opportunity to speak, not just leaders. It specifically was important that the technical teammates had the space to propose ideas based on the program office's goals.</li>
  </ul>
