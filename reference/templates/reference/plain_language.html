    You can improve the quality of the submissions you receive by making it
    easier for claimants to understand what the form questions mean. Below are
    examples of DOL-approved form question language that's easier for claimants
    to understand. Check out the "before and after," and update your own online
    forms to use the more user-friendly version of the question language if you
    use similar questions on your form.
