    When applicants don't understand a question or a notice, language becomes an equity issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many languages do not have different words for "laid off," "fired," and "quit." However,
    in the UI application context, it is important that applicants understand these concepts.
    Without clear definitions or additional context, applicants who speak English as a second
    language may face insurmountable barriers to or delays in receiving the benefits to which
    they are entitled.
