  <p>
    When applicants don't understand a question on the unemployment insurance (UI) application, it often leads to inaccurate responses that State Workforce Agency (SWA) staff must later investigate and resolve. Questions that are hard to understand also creates an equity issue, because it gives an unfair advantage to claimants with advanced reading levels, and who speak English as their first language. Leverage the examples below to learn about plain language best practices, and to inspire improvements in your own state or territory's unemployment application questions.

  <h2>Define Complex Terms</h2>
  <p>
    Many languages do not have different words for "laid off," "fired," and "quit," and even in English the definitions of those terms differ from state to state. In the UI application context, it is important that applicants understand these concepts so they can make an accurate selection. Without clear definitions or additional context, applicants who speak English as a second language, or who don't correctly interpret what a term means for the state in question, may face insurmountable barriers to applying, or may submit an inaccurate response that SWAs must investigate and correct. This creates burdens not only for the applicants, but also for SWA staff.
  </p>
  <p>
    When applicants were shown definitions, they slowed down, read this screen more carefully, and chose the correct answer, leading us to believe that this would also result in submissions that are easier and faster for SWA staff to process.

  <h2>Use Simpler Terms When Possible</h2>
  <p>
    There are tools and resources available for free that can analyze web content for readability. Word processing applications can also assess the grade level of your website or form content. If content is above grade 8, make edits to simplify the language. Small changes can remove barriers to access and reduce errors in applications.

  <h2>Break Up Long Sentences</h2>
  <p>
    Previously, the attestation sentence before the signature caused confusion. Splitting this sentence into two sentences without changing the content brought the reading level down to grade 8.

  <h2>Include Helper Text</h2>
  <p>
    People applying for unemployment insurance may be experiencing stress and anxiety as a result of their recent unemployment. When they are confronted with questions they don’t know how to answer, those feelings are compounded by their concern that an incorrect choice will lead to their application being rejected or denied.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Helper text” can supplement existing information or questions on the application, giving applicants more context or examples so they can provide the most relevant and accurate information.
