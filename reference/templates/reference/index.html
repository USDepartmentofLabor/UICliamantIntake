<section class="usa-section">
  <p>
    U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) is providing [describe features] to help State
    Workforce Agencies (SWAs) improve their delivery of Unemployment Insurance. These
    are the first in a series of examples demonstrating best practices for service
    delivery and can assist SWAs in iterating and evolving applications and programs
    to better serve people who need or want unemployment benefits.
  </p>

  <p>
    These example pages can be used by SWAs in building or modifying UI applications
    [and other features]. The goal is to demonstrate ways SWAs can create online
    application forms [and other features] that are user-friendly, succinct, and
    easily understood.
  </p>

  <p>
    This language was designed and refined by SWAs and USDOL, based on [statsâ€¦ maybe
    number of hours or number of interviews] of research with applicants, SWA staff,
    and USDOL staff.
