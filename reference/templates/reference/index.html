    Customer Experience (CX) and User Experience (UX) Design are incredibly important in ensuring that the people using your websites have an easy time, and give you information that's as easy as possible for you to process. The U.S. Department of Labor has done some pilot work with states to incorporate better CX/UX into their unemployment insurance (UI) claimant experiences, and the expected result is that the states will end up spending less time manually identity-proofing claimants, will see less fraud, and will receive clearer information submitted that leads to faster processing times. USDOL will be releasing the findings from this work over time to empower states to adopt these tactics and improve their claimants experiences. Click through the preliminary examples that USDOL has released to start implementing small but meaningful changes now, with more to come in the future.
