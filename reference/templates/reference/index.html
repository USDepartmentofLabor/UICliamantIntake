    The U.S. Department of Labor is currently working with states to help them modernize their unemployment insurance systems, making those systems more equitable, user friendly, accessible, and resistant to various types of fraud. One of the ways we're doing this is through pilot engagements: focused trials of new UI systems and processes that help us quickly learn what works best — and what doesn't — for the public and for SWA staff. We kicked off this collaboration in December 2021, working with the <a class="usa-link" href="https://www.nj.gov/labor/">New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development</a> and the <a class="usa-link" href="https://www.dws.arkansas.gov/">Arkansas Division of Workforce Services</a> on a <a class="usa-link" href="https://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/TEN/TEN_16-21_acc.pdf">Claimant Experience pilot</a> aimed at improving the usability of their UI applications. Click through the examples below to see the changes they made, and to see if there's anything you can adapt to make small but impactful changes to your own UI systems.

    We'll continuously update this site with information about future pilots, examples of completed work, and ways for SWAs to get involved.
