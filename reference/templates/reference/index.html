{% block title %} USDOL's recommended customer experience guidance for states to
improve claimant experience {% endblock %} {%block content %}
<section class="usa-section">
  <p>
    Customer Experience Design / User Experience Design is incredibly important
    in ensuring that the people using your website have an easy time, and give
    you information that's as easy as possible for you to process. The US
    Department of Labor has done some pilot work with states to incorporate
    better CXD/UXD into their claimant experiences, and the expected result is
    that the states will end up spending less time manually identity-proofing
    claimants, will see less fraud, and will received clearer information
    submitted that leads to faster processing times. USDOL will be releasing the
    findings from this work over time to empower states to adopt these tactics
    and improve their claimant experiences. Click through the preliminary
    examples that USDOL has released to start implementing small but meaningful
    changes now, with more to come in the future.
